# Text-Processing-Sentiment-Classifier
Develop Twitter sentiment classifiers, i.e., models that take as input a large set of tweets, and for each tweet predict its sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) based on the content.
Three different classifiers are used and their performances are compared. A technical analysis is provided to determine which model works better in which situation.
